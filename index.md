# Talend Patterns & Practices

Talend Patterns & Practices provides our customers and partners with reference architectures and guidance for building scalable and secure solutions using Talend products. The goal of this Architecture Center is to publish **logical and physical architectures** in order to help you understand the various components in our products, the relationship and interactions between them, and best practices around their deployment. The site also provide guidelines on **scalability, availability, security and sizing**.

The content starts off with **version 6.4** and our goal is to keep the content up to date and generate new content for every subsequent major version of the product.

The website provide links to download **visio files** (below Logical Reference Architecture images) and **Power Point Presentation** (in MDM) which can be utilized and modified to build your own custom solution architecture.

Since Talend provides a comprehensive set of products to enable customers to build their data integration as per their needs, to properly leverage the Talend products it is imperative to apply proper architecture, design and best practices when designing the platform and end solution.
