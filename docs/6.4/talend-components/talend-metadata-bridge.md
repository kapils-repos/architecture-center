# Talend Metadata Bridge

![Bridge][bridge]

Powered by Meta Integration® Model Bridge (MIMB), the Talend Metadata Bridge brings into the Talend Studio import and export capabilities for metadata – over 100 bridges. The bridges allow developers to design data structures once and propagate them across various tools and platforms repeatedly. Then you can easily enforce standards, propagate changes, and facilitate migrations, since data formats can be translated from virtually any third party tool or platform to Talend. For example, you can take an Oracle table and import it into Talend, and then propagate it to another third party platform such as Redshift. Talend Big Data can also easily offload a traditional ETL job into a native Hadoop process.

The basis for Talend Metadata Manager is
- Modelling metadata : This allows reusing and staying in sync with objects designed with a data and/or process modeling tools such as CA ErWin, Embarcadero ER/Studio, IBM Infosphere Data Architect or SAP Power Designer.
- Business Intelligence metadata : This allows reusing and staying in sync with semantic layers needed in Business Intelligence databases or front-ends such as Oracle Essbase and OBI, SAP BW or Business Objects, Microstrategy, QlikView, Tableau, and so on.
- ETL metadata : This allows importing/exporting metadata from other ETL tools such as IBM Infosphere DataStage, Informatica PowerCenter, and so on.  
- Productivity Tools (Excel) : This allows exposing or editing Talend metadata through Excel, Access, or Visio. For example a business user can use it to review, validate or even update Talend’s metadata definitions and mappings without having to learn our Studio.
