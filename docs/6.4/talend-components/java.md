# Oracle Java JDK – a Talend Pre-requisite
Server side and client side components all require an Oracle JDK (Java Development Kit) to run. Each component has its own specific pre-requisites, but the need for a JDK is consistent across all Talend components.

- As of Talend v6 only JDK 8 is supported by Talend* – Oracle no longer supports Java 7
  Exception: IBM AIX only has IBM Java 7 support, but only for specific Talend server components
- Talend recommends that you use the same JDK version on all clients and servers
- Compatible platforms / Java versions can be found in the [product documentation][product documentation]
- For more on Java please read official documentation on [Oracle Java Website][Java]
