# Introduction
Talend MDM is a model-driven, non intrusive solution easily adaptable to specific business needs and quick to implement. It has been specifically developed to address the challenges of creating and managing master data for all types of organizations where data is hosted under various formats in various systems and can be extremely volatile.

Talend Master Data Management (MDM) groups all the company's master data of the company in a central hub. This standardized repository provides, via the use of Data Models, the prerequisites against which data and updates are validated.

Talend MDM ensures the right people have the right tools to centrally model and manipulate master data. Its master data governance features are available through two different user interfaces: one is an administration tool called Talend Studio and the other is a web-based interface called Talend MDM Web User Interface.

The chart below illustrates the main building blocks (Talend Studio, Web browser ,MDM server & MDM database) of Talend MDM.
