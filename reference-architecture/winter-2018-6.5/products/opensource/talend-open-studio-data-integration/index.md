# Open Studio for Data Integration

## Introduction

Open Studio for Data Integration is robust open source ETL tool that you can download for free and start using to easily integrate all of your data with any database, cloud application, data warehouse, or synchronize data between systems.

## Architecture

Talend's data integration solution helps companies deal with growing system complexities by addressing both ETL for analytics and ETL for operational integration needs and offering industrialization features.

### Oracle Java JDK – a Talend Pre-requisite
Server side and client side components all require an Oracle JDK (Java Development Kit) to run. Each component has its own specific pre-requisites, but the need for a JDK is consistent across all Talend components.

- As of Talend v6 only JDK 8 is supported by Talend* – Oracle no longer supports Java 7
  Exception: IBM AIX only has IBM Java 7 support, but only for specific Talend server components
- Talend recommends that you use the same JDK version on all clients and servers
- Compatible platforms / Java versions can be found in the <a href="https://www.talend.com/products/data-integration/data-integration-manuals-release-notes/#product_user_manuals_pdf" target="_blank">Product Documentation</a>
