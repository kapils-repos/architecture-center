# Talend Open Source Products - Summer 2017 (6.4)

Talend helps you get up and running fast with a full range of robust, open source integration software tools for free download. The open source products are mostly meant to be used by 1 person locally on his workstation, and as such, does not require any infrastructure architecture planning. 

The open source products are:

- **[Open Studio for Data integration]({{site.baseurl}}/reference-architecture/summer-2017-6.4/products/opensource/talend-open-studio-data-integration/index)**
- **[Open Studio for Big Data]({{site.baseurl}}/reference-architecture/summer-2017-6.4/products/opensource/talend-open-studio-big-data/index)**
- **[Open Studio for Data quality]({{site.baseurl}}/reference-architecture/summer-2017-6.4/products/opensource/talend-open-studio-data-quality/index)**
- **[Open Studio for ESB]({{site.baseurl}}/reference-architecture/summer-2017-6.4/products/opensource/talend-open-studio-esb/index)**
- **[Open Studio for MDM]({{site.baseurl}}/reference-architecture/summer-2017-6.4/products/opensource/talend-open-studio-mdm-platform/index)**
- **[Data Preparation Free Desktop Edition]({{site.baseurl}}/reference-architecture/summer-2017-6.4/products/opensource/talend-open-studio-data-preparation/index)**

The only requirements are generally having a decent workstation with a recent i5 or i7 CPU, enough RAM (like 8GB or more), and SSD drive. Hence, this section around architecture will not dwell further on the architecture needs for the open source product. Their Getting Started Guide generally provides all the information needed for installing and getting started with using the open source products.
